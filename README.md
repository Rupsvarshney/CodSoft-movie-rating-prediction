# Movie Rating Prediction 

This project involves building a machine learning model to predict movie ratings based on features such as genre, director, and actors. The goal is to analyze historical movie data to uncover the factors influencing movie ratings and develop a model that accurately estimates ratings given by users or critics.

## üìå Project Overview  

The **Movie Rating Prediction** project provides an opportunity to explore:  
- **Data Analysis**: Understanding trends and relationships in historical movie data.  
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning, normalizing, and preparing data for modeling.  
- **Feature Engineering**: Identifying and transforming relevant features for prediction.  
- **Machine Learning**: Applying regression techniques to predict movie ratings.  

This project offers insights into the critical factors that drive movie ratings and allows us to estimate ratings for new or hypothetical movies.

## üõ†Ô∏è Features  

- Analyze historical movie datasets.  
- Preprocess data by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing numerical data.  
- Engineer features to enhance prediction accuracy.  
- Train and evaluate regression models such as Linear Regression, Random Forest, or Gradient Boosting.  
- Visualize factors influencing movie ratings.  

## üîç Dataset  

- The dataset includes features such as:
  - **Name**
  - **Year** 
  - **Genre**  
  - **Director**  
  - **Actor 1**
  - **Actor 2**
  - **Actor 3** 
  - **Duration**  
  - **Rating**  
  - **Votes**  

### Note:  
You can use public movie datasets like the [Kaggle datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/) for training and testing.

## üìà Methodology  

1. **Data Collection**: Import historical movie data from a reliable source.  
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Identify patterns and relationships in the data using visualization tools like Matplotlib and Seaborn.  
3. **Data Preprocessing**:  
   - Handle missing or inconsistent data.  
   - Encode categorical features like genre, director, and actors.  
   - Scale numerical features for better performance.  
4. **Feature Engineering**: Create new features or modify existing ones for improved prediction accuracy.  
5. **Model Building**: Train regression models and evaluate their performance using metrics such as RMSE, MAE, and R¬≤.  
6. **Evaluation and Optimization**: Fine-tune hyperparameters to improve model accuracy.  

## üìä Results  

- The model predicts movie ratings with reasonable accuracy based on selected features.  
- Insights into the factors that significantly influence movie ratings.  
- Visualizations showcasing the relationships between features and ratings.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack  

- **Languages**: Python  
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **Tools**: Jupyter Notebook or any Python IDE
